This is just written to test the first upload.  
Just reading [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) gives an how-to for this creating this blog

It says jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#### Test 1
{% highlight python %}
def fibnoacci(n):
    if n<0:
        return None 
    elif n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibnoacci(n-1) + fibnoacci(n-2)
print fibnoacci(2)
> 2
{% endhighlight %}

I plan to add my future experiments and posts on this blog. Stay tuned.
