Currently, I am working at Yahoo! Japan, Tokyo on Content Personalisation.

Earlier I graduated in 2015 from IIT Delhi where I studied courses on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science &
Mathematics. I also participated in numerous National Robotics Competitions. 

I enjoy working on problems involving data science.
