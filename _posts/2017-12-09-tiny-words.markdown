With a background of English & Hindi*, learning Japanese was astonishing.  It surprised at times by peculiarities like onomatopoeia, softness.  One of them was having tiny words and still able to carry significant meaning.

### What I want to talk about?

Usually the chinese writing system is said to be the same way. It has a lot of symbols where each symbol represent a concept. Japanese writing system has symbols inherited from the chinese and has similarly conceptual meaning. Like this æ£® represent a 'forest'.  Another fun moment was the realization of existence of one-phoneme words and still carrying meaning. For instance, you can just use 'e' for  stomach, 'a' for picture, 'mu' for concept of nothingness. Its contrasting from english or hindi where most nouns appears quite distinct. 

### What could be its consequences?

Out of my (limited) personal experience, it is harder to parse words in speech especially for unseen words.
Non-native japanese speakers should face more difficulty in absorbing the language.
Which is due to increase in complexity for resolution of words.
	
	
### Why is this a thing?

  Believing that humans care about efficiency,
  we would need a efficient data compression scheme(huffman encoding is a good example)
  which should be dependent on following features 
    * How important is utterance of that word?
			* If a word is uttered a lot of times, it should be important
				* like 'water' should be important than 'dry ice' 
		* How fundamental a concept is?
