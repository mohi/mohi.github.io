With a language background of English & Hindi, learning Japanese was astonishing.  It surprised at times by peculiarities like onomatopoeia, softness. One more of them was having tiny words and still able to carry significant meaning.  
    Note: Character readings should be read the way you read english alphabets for e.g. read 'e' as 'e' in 'elephant' and not 'e' in 'set'.  

## What this post is about?

**Single lettered nouns in Japanese**

The chinese writing system use pictographs for compaction. It has a lot of symbols where each symbol represents a concept. Japanese writing system has symbols inherited from the chinese and has similar kind of conceptual meaning. Like this symbol 森 represent a 'forest'.  Another fun moment was the realization of existence of one-phoneme words and still carrying meaning. For instance, you can just use 'e' for  stomach(胃), 'a' for picture(絵), 'mu' for concept of nothingness(無). It contrasts greatly from english or hindi where most nouns are longer. 

## What are its consequences?

**Harder to learn Japanese**

Out of my (limited) personal experience, it is harder to parse words in speech especially for unseen words.
Japanese learners face more difficulty in absorbing the language.
Which is due to increase in complexity for resolution of words.
	
	
## Why this might have happened?

**Communication Efficiency**

Believing that humans care about efficiency, we would need a efficient data compression scheme(huffman encoding is a good example) which should be dependent on following features 
  * How important is utterance of that word?
    * If a word is uttered a lot of times, it should be important. Like 'water' seems more important than 'dry ice' as humans need water more often than dry ice. 
  * How fundamental a concept is?
